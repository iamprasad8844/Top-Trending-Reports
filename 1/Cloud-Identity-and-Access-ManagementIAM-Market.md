As organizations continue to digitize their operations, the demand for robust identity and access management solutions that provide secure and seamless user authentication, authorization, and management has surged. The IAM market is expected to expand at a CAGR of over 15% from 2024 to 2030, as enterprises and governments invest heavily in secure, scalable cloud IAM systems to safeguard sensitive data and ensure regulatory compliance.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>The rapid digital transformation and the shift to hybrid work models are driving the need for more agile IAM solutions that can provide flexible, secure, and remote access to applications and data. Additionally, the growing use of multi-cloud environments and the need for centralized management of identities across multiple cloud platforms are expected to further fuel market growth. As security breaches and data thefts become more frequent, organizations are placing greater emphasis on adopting IAM solutions that offer advanced features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), identity governance, and privileged access management (PAM).</p> <p>Furthermore, the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are creating new challenges for IAM providers, pushing them to innovate and offer more sophisticated and automated solutions. Enterprises are increasingly seeking solutions that not only secure human identities but also manage non-human entities like devices, applications, and AI systems.
