Furthermore, the growing outdoor recreational activities and increasing use of repellents in urban and rural areas contribute to the market expansion. The rising healthcare awareness and government initiatives to combat vector-borne diseases are also major factors fueling the growth of the mosquito repellent ingredient market.  <h3>Market Growth Insights</h3> The global market for mosquito repellent ingredients is expected to grow at a robust pace due to the combination of key drivers. Increased public awareness about the health risks associated with mosquito bites has made consumers more inclined to use repellent products. Additionally, the advancement in formulation technologies for longer-lasting and more effective repellent ingredients is likely to increase product adoption rates. The market is also benefitting from the increased availability of various repellent types, such as sprays, lotions, and wearable devices, which cater to different customer needs.
