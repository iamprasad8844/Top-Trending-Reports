One key driver is the rising number of women becoming more health-conscious, particularly about nutrition, leading to higher adoption of dietary supplements. According to recent reports, more women are looking for supplements that not only fill nutritional gaps but also address specific concerns, such as bone health, hormonal balance, and digestive health. Additionally, the convenience of gummy vitamins, with their pleasant taste and easy consumption, appeals to busy women who are reluctant to take traditional pills. The increasing presence of health and wellness influencers and digital marketing strategies that promote these supplements also contribute to their growing popularity. The shift towards plant-based, vegan, and gluten-free formulations is another key factor driving market growth, as women increasingly seek clean-label, natural products with minimal artificial additives.
